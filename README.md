  MAG Depth Uniqueness & Interdisciplinarity

</h1>


Based on these, we can quantify the following:

Uniqueness: this is simply counter.

P.S. We cannot interpret “counter” as “innovation” or “novelty”. This is because one may argue that p can be innovative or novel compared to other papers that preceded it, even if all of them had the same vector as p and were published before p (e.g., if p is novel in the way it solved a particular problem, rather than being novel in the topics it studies). In contrast, interpreting “counter” as “uniqueness” is harder to argue against.

Interdisciplinarity: One way to measure this is in a way similar to lexicographic ordering. Specifically:

The most interdisciplinary papers are those whose 1st value in vector is greatest.
Out of those, the most interdisciplinary are those whose 2nd value is greatest
Out of those, the most interdisciplinary are those whose 3rd value is greatest
And so on…
Then, we have those whose 2nd value in vector is greatest. 
Out of those, the most interdisciplinary are those whose 3rd value is greatest
Out of those, the most interdisciplinary are those whose 4th value is greatest
And so on…

Depth: This is simply x.

P.S., it seems intuitive to interpret “x” as “depth”
